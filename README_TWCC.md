9. Select `c.super` (V100 GPU x1) for the configuration type, and click `REVIEW & CREATE`
   ![](docs/images/09-container-gpu.png)
10. Confirm again that you are using the correct wallet 「國網教育訓練用計畫」, and click `CREATE`.
    ![](docs/images/10-container-warning.png)
11. Wait for the container to be initialized and ready. You can click `REFRESH` to check the status after a few minutes.  
    **WARNING**: After finishing the tutorial, make sure to check the container and click `DELETE` to avoid using up all your credits.
    ![](docs/images/11-container-initializing.png)
12. When the container shows `Ready`, click the container name to enter the details page.
    ![](docs/images/12-container-ready.png)
13. Scroll down the container details page.
    ![](docs/images/13-container-details.png)
14. Click the `LAUNCH` button in the `Jupyter` row to open the Jupyter Notebook.
    ![](docs/images/14-container-jupyter.png)
15. Click `New` and then `Terminal` to open a terminal.
    ![](docs/images/15-jupyter.png)
    ![](docs/images/16-jupyter-new.png)
16. You can now run commands in the terminal.

## Environment Setup

In the terminal, run:

```sh
# Clone the repository and link the workspace
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/j3soon/LLM-Tutorial
ls -al /workspace
# Check the workspace does not contain any important data, all data in this directory will be deleted in the next step
sudo rm -rf /workspace
sudo ln -s $PWD/LLM-Tutorial/workspace /.
# Change ownership for NeMo 24.05, which is required when patching it later in the notebook
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) /opt/NeMo
# All done! Go back to Jupyter Notebook / Jupyter Lab
```

**Note**: To paste text in the jupyter terminal webpage, press `Ctrl+Shift+V`. To copy text, select the text, right-click, and choose `Copy`.

You should now see the `LLM-Tutorial` folder in the Jupyter file browser.

Navigate to `LLM-Tutorial/workspace` and open the notebook you want to run.

## Running the Notebook

Since these notebooks require a lot of time to run, we recommend you to run all cells before the last cell in the notebook (the last cell deletes all relevant data). Then, you can start going through the notebook.

- [NeMo_Training_TinyLlama.ipynb](workspace/NeMo_Training_TinyLlama.ipynb)
- [TensorRT-LLM.ipynb](workspace/TensorRT-LLM.ipynb)
- [NeMo_Guardrails.ipynb](workspace/NeMo_Guardrails.ipynb) (requires a [free NVIDIA NIM API Key](https://build.nvidia.com/mistralai/mixtral-8x22b-instruct))

## Deleting the Container

After you have finished the tutorial, make sure to delete the container to avoid using up all your credits.

The container list should be empty:

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Unexpected Errors During pip Install

If you have been using TWCC in the past, you may encounter unexpected errors during `pip install`. This is because TWCC mounts the user home directory automatically for ease of development. This will cause the package installed by `pip` to be stored under the `~/.local` directory. You can back up the `.local` directory and remove it:

```sh
mv ~/.local ~/.local.bak
mv ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.bak
```

and then delete and re-create the container (restarting the Jupyter kernel may not be enough).

After that, you should re-run the environment setup steps above (`rm`/`ln`/`chown`).

### Import Error in `click.core`

If you encounter the following error message:

```
ImportError: cannot import name 'ParameterSource' from 'click.core' (/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/click/core.py)
```

Run:

```sh
pip install -U click
```

as mentioned in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75568418), and re-run the cell.

### Disk Quota Exceeded

This may happen if you are using TWCC in the past and have somehow end up with zero disk quota due to no subscribed projects.

Example error message:

```
~$ git clone https://github.com/j3soon/LLM-Tutorial
Cloning into 'LLM-Tutorial'...
error: copy-fd: write returned: Disk quota exceeded
fatal: cannot copy '/usr/share/git-core/templates/hooks/fsmonitor-watchman.sample' to '/home/uXXXXXXX/LLM-Tutorial/.git/hooks/fsmonitor-watchman.sample': Disk quota exceeded
```

Click `VIEW DETAILS` in the user dashboard and check if the `Total Storage` quota is below `100GiB`. If so, you indeed stumbled upon the disk quota issue. The `HFS Portal` should show similar results.

![](docs/images/faq-disk-quota-issue-1.png)
![](docs/images/faq-disk-quota-issue-2.png)

Follow the steps below to resolve the issue:

1. Keep the used disk space below 100 GB for both `Home` and `Work` directories by removing unnecessary files.

   ![](docs/images/faq-disk-quota-solution-1.png)

2. In the `HFS User Portal`, click `Change Project` and apply the `國網教育訓練用計畫` project.

   ![](docs/images/faq-disk-quota-solution-3.png)
   ![](docs/images/faq-disk-quota-solution-4.png)

3. The disk quota should be restored to 100 GB. You may need to wait a while for the disk quota information to be updated.

### Unexpected Errors During sudo

If you encountered the following error message when running `sudo rm -rf /workspace`:

```
env: ‘rm’: Permission denied
```

This may be due to the `sudo` alias in `~/.bashrc` being added when installing conda. You can remove the alias by commenting the following line in `~/.bashrc`:

```
# alias sudo='sudo env PATH=$PA'
```

and then open a new terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc`.
